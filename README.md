# 🎓 EduAfrika API

EduAfrika API is a public, open-source API that provides structured access to data on educational institutions across Africa — from universities and colleges to high schools and vocational training centers.

## 🌍 Project Purpose

Africa has a vast and diverse educational landscape, but reliable, standardized data is often scattered or unavailable. **EduAfrika API** addresses this by offering a centralized, developer-friendly platform for discovering and analyzing schools across the continent.

## 🧱 Core Features

- 📚 View detailed academic programs including level, duration, and requirements
- 📍 Browse institutions by geographic location
- 🏷️ Categorize institutions using thematic tags (e.g., STEM, public, religious)
- 📞 Access contact channels such as email, phone, WhatsApp
- 📈 (Planned) Enable ratings, reviews, and statistics


## 🚀 Use Cases

- Students researching schools and programs
- Developers creating EdTech apps
- Researchers analyzing access to education
- NGOs/governments tracking education infrastructure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Laravel
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Public (JWT or token planned)
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger (in progress)

## 🤝 Contribution (Future Plan)
